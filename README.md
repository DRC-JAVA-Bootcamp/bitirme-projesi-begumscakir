# Therapist Finder
Therapist Finder aims to be used by therapists who wants to register into the system in order to be found by the most suitable visitors (potential clients),
and by visitors who wants to find the most suitable therapists.

# Therapists
* Therapists register into the system using their information; their name, ID number, subfield, therapeutic approach, year in the field, contact number and
how much they charge per session. ID numbers are not shared with visitors.
* Only psychologists who completed their Master's degree in Clinical Psychology can use the system as it is a must to be a therapist.
* Therapists' information are saved into a csv file.

# Visitors
* Visitors match with and see the most suitable therapists using the information they give.
* Visitors are anonymous and they're not saved into system.
* They need to be 18 or older to use the app.

# Matching Process
* Visitors can see all the suitable therapists.
* A visitor's language preference, matches with the languages therapists use in therapy.
* Support that a visitor want (for themselves, for their child etc.), matches with therapists' subfields (Adult Psychology, Children and Adolescence Psy. etc.).
* Visitor's expectation from therapy, matches with therapists' approach.
* Max cost a visitor is willing to pay per session is considered.

# Future Project Ideas:
* Visitors may book therapy sessions based on suitable dates and hours.
* Visitors and therapists may interact within the application.
PS- Ethical rules should be considered. 
* Other therapy approaches and subfields may be added.
